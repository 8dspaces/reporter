SendSMTP is a command-line program.  It consists solely of the sendsmtp.exe
file.  There is no setup program or setup procedures.  Put sendsmtp in a folder
(c:\windows\command on Win9x, or c:\winnt\system32 on NT/2000) and use it
from the command line.  You may put it in whatever directory you want.

Run SendSMTP by itself to see brief instructions.  Refer to the online
documentation for complete instructions.
